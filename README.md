# seven-minute-training-connectiq
A seven minute workout application for your Garmin device.

A fork of the project originally by [Janne Ohtonen](https://bitbucket.org/ohtonen/sevenminutetraining/src/master/) and available in the ConnectIq store as [7 Minute Workout - High Intensity Circuit Training](https://apps.garmin.com/en-US/apps/7257d7c6-821e-4ded-af9c-7d7c761f3b31).

# Description

This is a 7 minute workout timer for Vivoactive. You can Google more information about the exercise itself (High-Intensity Circuit Training Using Body Weight). This app follows the original exercises in that programme.
The 7-Minute Workout is a combination of circuit training and high-intensity interval training. Circuit training is essentially the use of sequential resistance exercises with little rest and has been proved to improve muscle fitness. High-intensity interval training is characterised by burst exercises with short recoveries and is a great way of improving aerobic fitness.

Exercise is important for your health, even if it’s only for a few minutes it’s better than nothing. It has been shown that a 4-minute high-intensity workout produces the same results as a 60-minute moderate-intensity workout. The 7-minute workout is also a great way of improving your baseline fitness before you move onto lengthier high-intensity workouts.

The workouts have 10 seconds between them. There are 13 workouts, each lasting 30 seconds. The workouts are:

JUMPING JACKS, WALL SIT, PUSH UPS, AB CRUNCHES, CHAIR STEPS, SQUATS, CHAIR TRICEPS, PLANK, HIGH KNEES RUNNING, LUNGES, PUSH UP ROTATIONS, SIDE PLANK LEFT, SIDE PLANK RIGHT

This app records your exercise and the heart rate and will require Sensor and Fit permissions for that reason. It will show calorie count in Garmin Connect after the exercise if you have used the heart monitor and synchronised. This enables you to see and monitor your Seven Minute exercises in the Garmin website. There is available information about calories, average and maximum heart rates amongst many other details. Just sync your watch to Garmin. The developer of this app will not have any access to any of the information you record. THIS DOES RECORD AND SYNC TO GARMIN. THIS SAVES HEART RATE AND CALORIES (emphasising since there is feedback saying it doesn't though it does).

This has been tested working with Garmin Vivoactive running 3.40 operating system.
